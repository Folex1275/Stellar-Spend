# Stellar-Spend Threat Model

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-06-27  
**Status:** Living document — review before each mainnet deployment

---

## 1. Scope

This threat model covers the Stellar-Spend off-ramp application:

- Next.js API server (bridge, payout, webhook routes)
- Soroban smart contracts (`escrow`, `treasury`, `fee-manager`)
- Browser frontend (wallet interaction, localStorage)
- CI/CD pipeline and deployment infrastructure

Out of scope: Allbridge Protocol internals, Paycrest backend, Stellar/Base protocol layers.

---

## 2. Assets

| Asset | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
|-------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| `BASE_PRIVATE_KEY` (payout wallet) | Critical | Critical | High |
| `PAYCREST_API_KEY` / `PAYCREST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | High | High | Medium |
| `DATABASE_URL` and user PII | High | High | High |
| Escrow contract settlement authority | Critical | Critical | High |
| User stablecoin funds (in-flight) | N/A | Critical | High |
| Transaction history (localStorage) | Medium | Medium | Low |
| CI/CD secrets (registry, deploy tokens) | High | High | Medium |

---

## 3. Trust Boundaries

```
[Browser] -- TLS --> [Next.js API] -- TLS --> [Paycrest API]
                                   -- RPC --> [Base Chain]
                                   -- RPC --> [Stellar Horizon/Soroban]
[GitHub Actions] --> [Container Registry] --> [Production K8s/Cloud]
[Paycrest] -- HMAC-signed webhook --> [/api/webhooks/paycrest]
```

---

## 4. Actors

| Actor | Trust Level | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Authenticated user | Low-Medium | Controls their own wallet; can craft malicious inputs |
| Paycrest webhook | Medium | Verified via HMAC-SHA512; IPs should be allowlisted |
| CI/CD pipeline | High | Has deploy credentials; supply-chain risk |
| External auditor | High | Read-only access to code and staging |
| Malicious browser extension | None | May intercept wallet interactions |
| Contract attacker | None | May try to drain escrow via replay/reentrancy |

---

## 5. Attack Surfaces & STRIDE Analysis

### 5.1 API Layer

| Threat | STRIDE | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Forged Paycrest webhook | Spoofing | HMAC-SHA512 verification + constant-time compare |
| Replay a payout request | Repudiation | Idempotency keys (`src/lib/idempotency.ts`) |
| Inject SQL via bank details | Tampering | Parameterized queries only |
| DoS via quote hammering | Denial of Service | Rate limiting (30 req/min/IP) |
| Leak `BASE_PRIVATE_KEY` via log | Information Disclosure | No key logging; Sentry PII scrubbing |
| Escalate to admin via API key | Elevation of Privilege | Scoped API keys with per-route checks |

### 5.2 Smart Contracts (Soroban)

| Threat | STRIDE | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Unauthorized release | Spoofing/EoP | `settlement_auth.require_auth()` on every release |
| Double-release / double-refund | Tampering | Boolean guards (`released`, `refunded`) checked before state change |
| Fund lock via bad timeout | DoS | `can_refund` available to depositor after `timeout_ledger` |
| Reentrancy during release | Tampering | Soroban execution model is atomic; no external calls mid-function |
| Upgrade to malicious WASM | Tampering | Multi-sig required for upgrade authority (issue #629) |
| Integer overflow on amount | Tampering | `i128` arithmetic; validate `amount > 0` |

### 5.3 Frontend / Wallet

| Threat | STRIDE | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| XSS via user-supplied content | Tampering | `isomorphic-dompurify` sanitization; strict CSP |
| localStorage key exfiltration | Information Disclosure | Never store private keys in localStorage |
| Phishing via wallet prompt | Spoofing | Display human-readable XDR summary before signing |
| MITM on RPC endpoint | Tampering | Pin RPC URLs in env; use TLS-only providers |

### 5.4 Supply Chain / CI

| Threat | STRIDE | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Compromised npm dependency | Tampering | `npm ci --frozen-lockfile`; Dependabot alerts; SBOM |
| Container base image CVE | Information Disclosure | Trivy/Grype scan on every build; weekly schedule |
| Leaked CI secret | Information Disclosure | Secrets scoped per environment; no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix |
| Malicious GitHub Action | Tampering | Pin all Actions to SHA; Dependabot for Actions |

## 6. High/Critical Findings (Pre-mainnet Gate)

> **No deployment to mainnet until all items below are resolved.**

| ID | Severity | Description | Status |
|----|----------|-------------|--------|
| TM-001 | Critical | Multi-sig not enforced on escrow `release` — single key controls all funds | Addressed by #629 |
| TM-002 | High | No SBOM or CVE gate in CI | Addressed by #644 |
| TM-003 | High | E2E tests ran against dev server (hot reload); must run against production build | Addressed by #643 |
| TM-004 | Medium | `lint --max-warnings` allowed 50 warnings, masking potential issues | Addressed by #643 |

---

## 7. Ongoing Review Cadence

| Activity | Frequency | Owner |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Automated CVE scan (Trivy + Grype) | Every PR + weekly | CI |
| `npm audit` | Every PR | CI |
| Threat model review | Before each mainnet upgrade | Security lead |
| External audit | Before mainnet launch, then annually | External firm |
| Dependency updates (Dependabot/Renovate) | Weekly | Automated |
| Incident response drill | Quarterly | Ops team |

---

## 8. Out-of-Scope Risks (Accepted)

- Stellar or Base consensus failures (protocol-level; beyond our control)
- Paycrest API outages (handled via retry + user notification)
- User's own wallet compromise (non-custodial by design)
